### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Dan. I currently spend most of my days writing code as a Software Engineer. Previously, I built internal tools for financial operations. Before that, I earned a degree in mathematics. You can reread this and a few more sentences on my [personal landing page](https://dansahagian.com).

My email is listed in my profile if you want to say hello, or you can check out my projects below:
